Homework assignment:
Write a C/C++ client that will interact with a REST API.
The project must be a CLI interface that acts like a UI interface for the
virtual library.

Preamble:
In the homework's implementation, I used the files provided at [1.LAB 10 PCOM]
I did the homework in C++ to use some functions and because I am more familiar
with C++.

File structure:
    - buffer.cpp && buffer.h (used for helpers, works with buffers)
    - helpers.cpp && helper.h (already implemented functions)
    - data.h (holds the constants and enumerations)
    - interface.h && interface.cpp(for drawing the interface and things on the screen)
    - input_analyzer.cpp && input_analyzer.h (for identifying and calling
    functions)
    - aux.h && aux.cpp - extra functions
    - Makefile (for compilion the homework; arguments: <> - nothing = make,
    <run> - run the client, <clean> - remove the executable)
    - client.cpp (holds the client implementation, the main loop)

Description:
    The main file, the client.cpp, is a loop that receives the commands,
    sets an ID to the commands and sends that ID to a switch loop that
    executes the corresponding actions for each type of command inserted.

    For writing and reading JSON, I created my own parser, just a for loop
    that goes through the received string of form
    {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"} and prints it in the true JSON form.

    The interface is made so that it looks beautiful to the user, being
    implemented in the "interface.cpp" file, a singleton class used for all
    the printing to the terminal and for getting all the input.
